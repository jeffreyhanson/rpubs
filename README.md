# Source code for Rpubs documents

This repository contains the source code for my documents on [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/jeffreyhanson). Each directory corresponds to a different Rpubs document. Documents can be rebuilt using the system command `make doc prj=project_name` (e.g. `make doc prj=gremlin-subgraphs`). Please feel free to fork this repository, contribute, correct spelling mistakes, or tell me when I'm just plain wrong!
